# Cameras-Calit2IRT

## General Timeline of the Project
_Fall 2025 (2D prototype)_: Recording, training, testing approaches on one to two flies within a petri dish. Have a 2D camera accurately identifying one to two flies and achieve both mating choice and startle response testing for assays for two flies.

_Winter 2025 (3D setup)_: Have a 3D camera setup working, track multiple flies; quantify the startle response testing and begin behavioral (mating assay) classification. 

_Spring 2025 (Analysis)_: Run long-term group assays; finalize data analysis and presentation.
